# Nix Configuration

Welcome to my Nix configuration for both macOS and NixOS. This repository contains configuration files and package setup for each host of a respective system. Some configurations are shared between the two systems and between different hosts.

Feel free to explore the repository and take ideas for your Nix configuration!
